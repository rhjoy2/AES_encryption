# AES_encryption
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher encryption that receives 128-bit size for each block and the size of key is 128, 192, and 256 bits. AES procedure involves some encryption rounds, which are determined by the cipher key size

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability,
data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store
and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and
restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. You have two options for
protecting data at rest in Amazon S3. Server-Side Encryption – Request Amazon S3 to encrypt your object
before saving it on disks in its data centers and then decrypt it when you download the objects. Client-Side
Encryption – Encrypt data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage
the encryption process, the encryption keys, and related tools.


1. This tool uses Javascript to implement the Client-Side Encryption Tool Interface.
2. Implemented AES-256 encryption and decryption using a crypto Library
3. The output of encrypted message is in Hexadecimal.
